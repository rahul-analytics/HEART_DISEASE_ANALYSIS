📌 Project Overview

This project presents a Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard built to analyze patient health data and identify patterns related to survival,
age groups, serum levels, diabetes, and gender distribution.

The dashboard provides interactive visual insights that help in understanding key health indicators and their impact on patient outcomes.

📊 Dashboard Highlights

🔢 Key Metrics

* Total Alive Patients: 132

* Total Deaths: 62

* Average Alive Age: 58.83

* Alive Percentage: 68.04%
________________________________________________________
📈 Visualizations Included

* Total Alive by Age Group

* Shows survival distribution across age categories

* Identifies highest survival rate in specific age ranges

* Total Alive Cancer (Age-wise comparison)

* Compares age groups with survival counts

* Helps identify high-risk age segments

* Average Serum Levels by Age Group

* Analyzes serum creatinine levels

* Observes trends across different age brackets

* Total Alive and Sum of Diabetes

* Examines relationship between survival and diabetes cases

* Identifies diabetes impact on heart disease patients

* Gender Filter (Interactive)

* Toggle between Male and Female

* Allows gender-based analysis
